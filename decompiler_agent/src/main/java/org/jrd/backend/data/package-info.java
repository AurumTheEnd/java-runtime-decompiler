/**
 * This package contains copypasted code from runtime-decompiler
 * This should remain as it is without excuses. Any developmen should happen in runtime-decompiler and then copypasted here.
 *
 * Thsi duplication have to remain minimal. Currently the only one file here should be
 *  - MetadataProperties.java
 *  - metadata.prop
 * which ensures handshake between runtime-decompiler and agent
 * Both should remain identical for ever.
 *
 * Once windows support symlinks, just link them and we are done...
